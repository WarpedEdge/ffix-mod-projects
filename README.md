# FFIX-MOD-PROJECTS

## Purpose:
Just a public repo where I store all things related to my mod projects for anyone to grab, use, etc.

## Folder Structure

### _Archive
All old files that can at any time be subjected to be deleted

### PlayableCharacterPack
All files related to the mod PlayableCharacterPack. This includes finished, WIP, or concepts.

The actual bundle of the mod that goes into your `Final Fantasy IX` folder will be in the `Versions` directory, but using the Memoria launcher to download it is the recommended way.

### WikiFiles
All references that would be used in the `Wiki` section of this repo.
