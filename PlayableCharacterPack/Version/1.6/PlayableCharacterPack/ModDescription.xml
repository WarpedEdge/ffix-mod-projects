Currently, these characters are added:

- Ophelia (Alexandrian soldier)
- Dan
- Jeame (Cleyra dancer)
- Puck
- Mikoto *NEW*
- Gerome (Genome) *NEW*
- Ruby *NEW*
- Baku *NEW*

Bug Fixes:
- Jeame's Debilitation description fixed as well as the effect correctly lowering ATK/MATK
- Jeame's dance text added when casted
- Dan's main attack is now Mug like originally intended


You can press Alt+F2 or Ctrl+Alt+Shift+F2 if on Linux in-game to access the party menu (changing the party at any time is a feature of Memoria, not related to this mod).

Special Thanks for their important help:
- Emeiru (support)
- Hope (scripting)
- faospark (concept art)
- samtoki (character portraits)
- DV (ability sequences and features)

You should set the priority of this mod to be higher than the priority of the Moguri mod but lower than other mods.</Description>
