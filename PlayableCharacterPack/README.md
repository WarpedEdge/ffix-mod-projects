# Playable Character Pack

## Disclaimer: 
### Some Items that have currently used any form of `gen AI` are as follows:
 - Portraits for newer characters
 - Weapon textures (Mainly just for testing)

These items are only placeholders, and I plan on getting some help from real artists whether by assistance or commissioning them.

## Folder Structure

### Costumes
For all costume options for characters completed, concepts, WIP, etc.

### Face Atlas
For all Face Atlas options completed, concepts, WIP, etc.

### MainCast
Houses the necessary information for all main/guest characters.

### MiscCast
Houses the necessary information for characters not being added, but using things from them, e.g. `Baku` using `KingLeo` casting animation or the `Enemy Baku` attacks.

### NewCast
Houses the necessary information for the newly playable characters being planned on being added.

### Templates
Self-Explanatory

### Weapons
Houses the textures of original and customized weapons that are being created. Currently making new weapons I have to use models from existing weapons, but change the textures to make the look "new".
